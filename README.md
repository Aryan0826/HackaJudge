## **Hack'A'Judge**: Streamlined Hackathon Judging Software

**Hack'A'Judge** is a web-based platform designed to transform hackathon judging by replacing the slow, error-prone paper-based processes with a fast, digital solution. 

Built in just ***24 hours*** during the .devHacks Hackathon, **Hack'A'Judge** enables judges to score teams and provide feedback, with results visualized in _real-time_ on a dynamic bar graph. 

Organizers can configure teams, judges, and scoring criteria through an intuitive admin panel, making judging seamless and transparent.

The old way paper-based judging took an hour of manual calculations. **Hack'A'Judge** <ins>cuts that down to minutes</ins>, automating score aggregation and eliminating errors. 

We built this to make hackathon judging as innovative as the projects being judged!

## Features

- **Flexible Scoring System**: Judges score teams based on customizable criteria (e.g., _innovation_, _design_, _functionality_) with configurable point scales (out of 5 or 10).
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Judges submit scores and written feedback, instantly recorded in the system.
- **Live Visualization**: A dynamic bar graph, powered by Chart.js, displays _real-time_ scores, showing the current leaderboard as judging progresses.
- **Admin Panel**: Organizers can:
  - Set the number of teams and judges.
  - Define scoring criteria and point systems.
  - Monitor scores and feedback in a centralized dashboard.
- **Time-Saving Automation**: Replaces manual tallying, <ins>reducing judging time</ins> and ensuring accuracy.

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional hackathon judging relies on paper scorecards, which leads to:

- **Delays**: Manual score aggregation can take hours.
- **Errors**: Miscalculations or misplaced sheets undermine fairness.
- **Opacity**: No real-time visibility into standings.

**Hack'A'Judge** digitizes the process, delivering ***speed, accuracy, and engagement*** with a live leaderboard that keeps everyone in the loop.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Visualization**: Chart.js
- **Design**: Images and assets edited with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop

We all worked collectively on both the frontend and backend, as this was our first hackathon project and weâ€™re still learning the ropes!
